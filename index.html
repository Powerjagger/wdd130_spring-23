    <p> Hi, I'm James Green. I don't have anything fancy to say but at the same time I doubt that most of the class will read this. You may have noticed the green in the background. Well those things are called trees which do not seem to exist out here.
        Anyway I'm here for a software engineering degree, maybe find some friends, maybe find a girl. I don't know but in any sense I think that this is the required word count so byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. </p>
